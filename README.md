Sass Starter
============

In which we deliberately don't use Compass!

To Use
======

* You will need Node, Grunt, and Bundler
* From the command line, cd into the folder
* Run "npm install"
* Run "bundle install"
* Run "grunt watch"
* To stop watching, use Ctrl+C

To create a custom modernizr build based on your code, run "grunt modernizr:dist".

To Do
=====

* Get LiveReload (or alternative) working
* Play with KSS - http://warpspire.com/kss/ & http://mikefowler.me/2013/10/14/static-styleguides-kss-node/ & https://github.com/t32k/grunt-kss 
* Create a "starter" icon font of frequently used icons (Facebook, Twitter, arrows, etc.)
